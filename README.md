== Description ==
Project Tabletop is a web application that allows tabletop roleplayers to search for other tabletop roleplayers online. This is performed through a posts system containing Looking-For-Member (LFM) and Looking-For-Group (LFG) posts. Players looking for members should recruit players who have created LFM posts and players looking for groups should look for LFG posters to message.


== How to Run ==
The project is hosted via AWS Elastic Beanstalk on the following URL:
