Requires at least: 1.0

== Description ==
Project Tabletop is a web application that allows tabletop roleplayers to search for other tabletop roleplayers online. This is performed through a posts system containing Looking-For-Member and Looking-For-Group posts.


== How to Run ==
Currently there are two ways to test the project. One method is to simply interact with the website hosted on c9.io at url: https://project-tabletop-front-end-rotten.c9users.io/
The other is to download the project from the GitHub master branch and run it locally.
